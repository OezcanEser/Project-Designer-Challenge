            <h2><span>Every idea</span> starts with a need</h2>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper
                and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.</p>
            <h2>After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot</h2>
            <section>
                <h4>Start with asking</h4>
                <p>why You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more effective ways of achieving
                    goals.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Your ideas will have more value</h4>
                <p>By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more valuable.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h4>Design solutions with love</h4>
                <p>Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and
                    resolve to end it.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Share and show your work</h4>
                <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You
                    will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>
