            <h2><span class="ideasStyle">Every idea</span> starts with a need</h2>

            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper
                and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.</p>

            <h2>After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot</h2>

            <section>

                    <span>
                        You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more effective ways of
                        achieving
                        goals.

                        By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more
                        valuable.

                        resolve to end it.

                        As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect.
                        You
                        will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
